-  Hi, I’m @armanscien3
-  I’m interested in Machine learning, Deep Learning,digital Image Processing and remote sencing
-  currently, I am  learning Deep Learning and I plan to share with you in detail, what I am learning. They can be a good reference for our future projects. I will start with a quick look at the Python language and then useful libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, as well as AI mathematics.
-  Also, I will review basic digital image processing topics that can be useful in machine learning and deep learning, along with Python code written by me using the OpenCv library, and then start projects.
-  since  machine learning and deep learning have many applications in remote sensing, after finishing the topics related to digital image processing, I will discuss topics related to satellite images and remote sensing.
